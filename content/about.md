Hello! My name is Megh, I'm a Software Engineer and Clojure enthusiast. Currently, like a million others in the silicon valley, I'm building a GenAI startup called [r2decide](https://r2decide.com). At r2decide we're trying to change the eCommerce shopping interface.

Previously I worked as a Backend Engineer at [Helpshift](https://www.helpshift.com), a place where I met a lot of cool people, shipped my first production feature, and fell in love with Clojure. I learnt a lot of new things from senior engineers who had been working at the company for a really long time. They have really molded me into the half-decent software engineer I am today. I'm super grateful to them, and through the stuff I post on this site, I would like to pass on the few little things I've learnt throughout this journey. In addition to this, I will also write about my work at r2decide and how LLMs can be annoying :)
